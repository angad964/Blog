            Woke up, brushed, went to see what time it was, still so dark outside. Thought it must be around 6. Apparently it was 4:40am. Didnt believe it, felt maybe i should go back to sleep. I went to bed, tried to sleep, failed. Could see my family members sleeping soundly, and here all i was doing was overthinking. "Good thing its only me who is overthinking" "What the actual shit is going on", couldnt believe it, i thought of many things, many different outcomes, one scared me, felt actual fear which i never felt in a long time. It was lingering, felt even worse. Thought to just not think about it, would be easy right? Well not exactly. The feeling was just depressing. To think about it was enough to make me sentimental. "Am i even real? Or do i just exist, as a sole purpose to waste oxygen". Thought about it till 5, checked my watch. Felt even worse. I had flashbacks. Those were enough to make me cry. Thought to distract myself. Tried to think of other things, the feeling was reduced, not gone. Can't imagine anything. Thought i was well more than prepared for anything, maybe not this. Thinking "I dont know what to do". The more i thought the more i started to cry. Supressed my sound enough to not wake anybody up. "Why am i crying?". More thoughts rushed in, seriously wanted to just turn my brain off. Couldnt do that of course. Stayed alone with my own thoughts then, the tears dried on my face, could feel them drying up. "Why am i like this? Just someone who does the most worst shit to everybody" i start to realise why i was a loner in the first place. Felt my throat get this itchy, heavy feeling. "If i were to stay alone, what really could have happened?", i mean i wouldve been even more depressed than i am currently that is for sure. Others wouldnt really have to suffer with my sorry ass. A coward really, that's what i shouldve been called, 'Mr Coward'. Suits me better. I check to see the time, it's 5:49. "Do i even deserve anything that i have?", not really. I try to do something it always some way or the other fails, i give it everything, i then faceplant, i try to make something better, i screw it up. I try to make myself fall asleep, that too fails. What do i even have that i am so afraid of losing. Something which made the impossible seem possible, something which made me actually have belief in myself. Now where is it? In a worse place, i am just horrible. I try to do it my all, instead make it even worse. This just shows what level of incompentency i have. Its 7 but still a lot of time for others to wake up, alas its a sunday. I had a lot of memories, i couldnt control but i woke up, went in my balcony, sat on a chair, started to weep. How could i have possibly done this? I wanted her to not be like this, instead i wanted just the best. I am the problem is what came as a final outcome. I went back to go sleep and drowned myself with thoughts until 9. I woke up and i had no idea how i could recover, i washed my face and to distract myself i started working on history, then i started working on this. The afternoon was me drowning myself into these thoughts again. "Should i say sorry again? No she'll hate you even more, she hates sorry people", this wasnt anything which i could fix, i panic, i grabbed a glass and drank water, felt a bit better. But not good enough. She hates me, she hates me im so godamn sure i would put my soul onto it, she and i both know what i've done would mean the utter-most disrespectful thing, i want to say sorry even more, but she'll get even angry,i dont know i am confused, lost even. I just dont want anything bad to happen to her. I am just really sorry to her right now, i don't even know what the next outcome of this will be. What's in store for me now? I have absolutely no idea. Expecting another blog tommorow hopefully.
